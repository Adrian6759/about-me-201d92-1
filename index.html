  <main>
    <p>My name is Coriana Williams and I am from Alabama but residing in Georgia. I got stationed in Georgia in 2017 and post military obligations desided to remain here for work opportunities in the Information Technologies community. Before becoming an I.T. Anaylst, I worked as a Human Resource specialist while persuing a technical college for general studies at night. This would be my second time attending school, 2011 being the first at the University of South alabama.</p>

    <p>I've spend a good amount of time trying to figure out what my career purpose and home would be. Taking into account locations, earnings, and overall happiness I was drawn to the development community. My goal is to be happy with my decision, and to finish what I start with this career choice. Taking these steps to get started wasn't easy on my part, mainly because of self dought and lack of motivation but I am here and I am ready for the experience. This journey is mine, it is personal and I will not be overcome by lack of confidence anymore. My goal is to win!</p>
